The storage slot is configured to start at address 0x0 of the SPI flash, and have a size of 512 kB. This can be configured on the \"Storage\" tab.\n"},{"imageURL":"bundleentry://446.fwk1328584102/icons/projectNew.svg","supportDocuments":["file:/C:/SiliconLabs/SimplicityStudio/v5/offline/sdk/gecko-sdk/app/flex/documentation/example/connect/connect_ncp_app/readme.md"],"description":"Connect: NCP Application for the SoC","id":"template.uc.com.silabs.sdk.stack.super:4.4.6._1688545702.connect_ncp.../../protocol/flex/app/ncp-app/connect_ncp.slcp","text":"Connect - NCP","priority":9999999,"category":"SOFTWARE","toolTipText":"Connect: NCP Application for the SoC"},{"imageURL":"bundleentry://446.fwk1328584102/icons/projectNew.svg","supportDocuments":["file:/C:/SiliconLabs/SimplicityStudio/v5/offline/sdk/gecko-sdk/app/flex/documentation/example/connect/connect_soc_direct_mode_device/readme.md"],"description":"This sample app allows direct commissioning of nodes and exchange data between them via CLI commands.","id":"template.uc.com.silabs.sdk.stack.super:4.4.6._1688545702.connect_soc_direct_mode_device.example/connect/connect_soc_direct_mode_device/connect_soc_direct_mode_device.slcp","text":"Connect - SoC Direct Mode Device","priority":9999999,"category":"SOFTWARE","toolTipText":"This sample app allows direct commissioning of nodes and exchange data between them via CLI commands."},{"imageURL":"bundleentry://446.fwk1328584102/icons/projectNew.svg","supportDocuments":["file:/C:/SiliconLabs/SimplicityStudio/v5/offline/sdk/gecko-sdk/app/flex/documentation/example/connect/connect_soc_ecdh_key_exchange/readme.md"],"description":"This sample application illustrates how to share the network key between multiple devices in a secure way (using Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement protocol).","id":"template.uc.com.silabs.sdk.stack.super:4.4.6._1688545702.connect_soc_ecdh_key_exchange.example/connect/connect_soc_ecdh_key_exchange/connect_soc_ecdh_key_exchange.slcp","text":"Connect - SoC ECDH Key Exchange","priority":9999999,"category":"SOFTWARE","toolTipText":"This sample application illustrates how to share the network key between multiple devices in a secure way (using Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement protocol)."},{"imageURL":"bundleentry://446.fwk1328584102/icons/projectNew.svg","supportDocuments":["file:/C:/SiliconLabs/SimplicityStudio/v5/offline/sdk/gecko-sdk/app/flex/documentation/example/connect/connect_soc_empty/readme.md"],"description":"The Connect Empty project is a barebone Connect app that can be a basis of streamlined proprietary solutions.","id":"template.uc.com.silabs.sdk.stack.super:4.4.6._1688545702.connect_soc_empty.example/connect/connect_soc_empty/connect_soc_empty.slcp","text":"Connect - SoC Empty","priority":9999999,"category":"SOFTWARE","toolTipText":"The Connect Empty project is a barebone Connect app that can be a basis of streamlined proprietary solutions."},{"imageURL":"bundleentry://446.fwk1328584102/icons/projectNew.svg","supportDocuments":["file:/C:/SiliconLabs/SimplicityStudio/v5/offline/sdk/gecko-sdk/app/flex/documentation/example/connect/connect_soc_mac_mode_device/readme.md"],"description":"A 802.15.4 sample app that provides CLI commands to form a network or join an existing network, send data to another node based on short or long addresses.","id":"template.uc.com.silabs.sdk.stack.super:4.4.6._1688545702.connect_soc_mac_mode_device.example/connect/connect_soc_mac_mode_device/connect_soc_mac_mode_device.slcp","text":"Connect - SoC MAC Mode Device","priority":9999999,"category":"SOFTWARE","toolTipText":"A 802.15.4 sample app that provides CLI commands to form a network or join an existing network, send data to another node based on short or long addresses."},{"imageURL":"bundleentry://446.fwk1328584102/icons/projectNew.svg","supportDocuments":["file:/C:/SiliconLabs/SimplicityStudio/v5/offline/sdk/gecko-sdk/app/flex/documentation/example/connect/connect_sink_sensor/readme.md"],"description":"The Sink example is the counterpart of the Sensor example.
